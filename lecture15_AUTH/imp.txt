Auth
  |-> Authentication -> login, sign up (password -> hashing)
  |-> Authorization -> if the current user has a required access of a functionality or process

  
Authentication -> bcrypt -> to encrypt a string -> hashing -> converting a "string" word to another by adding buffers(random characters), so that guessing or decoding original value of "string" is nearly impossible
